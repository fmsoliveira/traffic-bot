# Traffic Bot

## Description

This project is part of a tuition program at AI Academy. The objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting traffic patterns and road accidents. The model will also aim to detect unusual or anomalous events in traffic data, contributing to improved road safety and traffic management. The project integrates all concepts learned during the course modules, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
